Users in the sidebar are sorted alphabetically and following the character code order (see the image below). For example, a user's name or nickname starting with `!` will have them appear near or at the top of the member list. "Dehoisting" is modifying a user's nickname such that they will no longer appear at the top of the list. When using Vortex's dehoisting features, you are required to provide a symbol to dehoist. This will dehoist all users that have a name starting with that symbol, as well as all the symbols that would cause someone to be higher on the list than that.

The following symbols can be used for dehoisting:  
`!` `"` `#` `$` `%` `&` `\'` `(` `)` `*` `+` `,` `-` `.` `/`

As an example, if the user list starts like this:
```
! Spectra
%%_100_%%
(Epic) Gamer
Andrew
```
Dehoisting `+` would dehoist the top 3 names, as they all get sorted at or above `+`
