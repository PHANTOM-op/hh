## ℹ History and Motivation
Vortex started as a bot to stop mass-mention spammers in their tracks and delete advertisements. At the time, it was becoming almost a daily occurrence that someone using a selfbot or other spam tool would join a server and start mentioning as many different people at once. Additionally, it was meant to be able to perform moderation actions en-masse, like banning a long list of people. Over time it also gained some other simple features like detecting and removing spammed messages, preventing raids, and some basic logging. 

## ℹ About the Developer
That's me! I'm jagrosh#4824 (113156185389092864), and I've been moderating Discord servers and developing bots for over 2 years. I've been programming for over 10 years, and also graduated from college with a degree in Computer Science. I own several large servers, including the Monster Hunter Gathering Hall (60,000+ members), the Yggdrasil Treehouse (25,000+ members), Discord Giveaways (10,000+ members), and my [bot development server](https://discord.gg/0p9LSGoRLu6Pet0k) (7,500+ members). I also moderate on servers such as Discord Bots, Zelda Universe, Cleverbutts, and several bot support servers. I'm also the author of a few semi-popular bots such as [JMusicBot](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot), [GiveawayBot](https://giveawaybot.party), and [Yggdrasil](https://ygg.fun). My experiences managing these servers, as well as feedback and usage of my bots on other servers, has shown me many of the common issues that servers face when it comes to poor behavior and moderation inconsistency. I've built Vortex to try to solve as many of these issues as possible!
