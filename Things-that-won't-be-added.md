Vortex is a moderation bot. Vortex is not meant to be a utility bot, nor a "fun" or "games" bot. Additionally, as a moderation bot, Vortex's commands are only meant to be used by moderators; commands that regular (non-staff) users will not be added. In general, regular users in a server will never need to use a command or even know how to use Vortex. The following is a list of common features that will not be added.

### Self-Assignable Roles via Command (`%roleme` / `.iam` / `?rank`)
Despite being a popular and useful feature, this type of command won't be added. These commands are primarily meant to be used by users (not moderators/staff), and Vortex as a bot purely for moderation won't have commands intended to be used by users.

### Tags or Custom Commands
Tags generally are used by regular users and staff alike, and thus would not be added for the same reason as other non-staff commands. Custom commands would only make sense on a moderation bot if the custom commands performed some sort of moderation; if you don't believe that the current set of commands is sufficient for moderation, considering joining the support server and requesting a command or tool that would be useful. A built-in command will often perform the job better and more efficiently, and (more importantly) the idea might be tweaked into something even _more_ useful that the original idea.

### Global Ban List
Global ban lists are never ever ever a good idea. A global ban list is always (_always_) biased by the people that run it. A global ban list also doesn't account for variance of rules; what is a "ban-able" offense on one server might be perfectly fine on another. Any "proof" for a global ban list could be easily faked. Finally, if someone is breaking Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discordapp.com/terms), please [**report it to Discord**](https://dis.gd/contact)! Discord can take care of ToS violations in larger-scale ways than trying to ban someone from a bunch of servers via some global ban list.
