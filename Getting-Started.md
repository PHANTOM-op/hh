## ðŸŒ€ Adding Vortex to Your Server
The first step is to make sure that Vortex is actually on your server! To add a bot to your server, you must have the **Manage Server** permission on the server. If you do, you can click this link to add Vortex to your server:

**https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=240254129333731328&permissions=500559086&scope=bot**

If your server isn't listed, make sure you are correctly logged in by visiting https://discordapp.com/login

## ðŸŒ€ Check Vortex's Permissions
To operate correctly, Vortex needs the permissions to be able to complete necessary tasks. The easiest way to achieve this is to give the 'Vortex' role the Administrator permission and drag it to the top (or near the top) of the role list.

## ðŸŒ€ Settings

The next step is configuring vortex for your server! You can type `>>help settings` to see a full list of settings commands, `>>help automod` to see a full list of automod commands, or check out the [[Full Command Reference|Commands]]

### Muted Role
The Muted role is a role that (usually) can be applied to a user to prevent them from sending messages, adding reactions, speaking, and connecting to voice channels. To create a Muted role with this default functionality, run `>>mute setup`. You can also customize the permissions after creation to your liking (such as also causing it to remove Read Messages perms in some channels, or allowing sending messages in a "time-out" channel). 

### Logs
Vortex has various logs to keep track of different kinds of server activity. All commands for logs are found in the Settings commands, available via `>>help settings` or on the [[Full Command Reference|Commands]]. If your server is utilizing the [[strike system|Strikes]], it is recommended to enable (at minimum) the ModLog.

### Moderator Role
The Moderator Role is a role that allows a user with said role to use all Moderation commands. The full list of Moderation commands is available via `>>help mod` as well as on the [[Full Command Reference|Commands]]. To set a role to be the Moderator role, use `>>modrole <rolename>` (for example, if your moderator role is called "Staff", you'd run `>>modrole Staff`). To disable the Moderator role, run `>>modrole none`. 

If no Moderator role is set, Moderation commands can only be run if the user has sufficient permissions natively (they would only be able to ban someone with Vortex if and only if they could ban them via the Discord client as well).

Also, make sure to check out the [[Moderator Guide]] for helpful tips for moderating with Vortex!

### AutoMod
For full information about the AutoMod and its features, check out the [[Auto-Moderation]] page. You can set the default automod settings using `>>setup automod`.
