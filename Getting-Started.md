## ðŸŒ€ Adding Vortex to Your Server
The first step is to make sure that Vortex is actually on your server! To add a bot to your server, you must have the **Manage Server** permission on the server. If you do, you can click this link to add Vortex to your server:

**https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=240254129333731328&permissions=500559086&scope=bot**

If your server isn't listed, make sure you are correctly logged in by visiting https://discordapp.com/login

## ðŸŒ€ Check Vortex's Permissions
To operate correctly, Vortex needs the permissions to be able to complete necessary tasks. The easiest way to achieve this is to give the 'Vortex' role the Administrator permission and drag it to the top (or near the top) of the role list.
