Vortex's automod features will ignore anyone with roles that it is ignoring. It will also ignore channels that are on its ignore list. You can see the list of ignored roles by running the `>>ignore` command with no arguments.

If a role has **[can't interact]** it means that it is above Vortex's highest role. If a role has **[elevated perms]** it means that it has a permission such as Ban Members, Manage Messages, Kick Members, Manage Server, or Administrator.

You can add roles (or channels) to this list by running the `>>ignore` command with the name of the role or a mention of the channel, and you can remove ignores that you added with the `>>unignore` command. *You can unignore any channels, but you cannot unignore roles that are ignored because of "can't interact" or "elevated perms".*
