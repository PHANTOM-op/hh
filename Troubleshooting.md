# General Troubleshooting
### ⚠ Check Vortex's Permissions
Does Vortex have the necessary permissions to perform the action you want it to? Try giving Vortex the Administrator permission and moving the 'Vortex' role to the top (or near the top) of the role list. If this fixes your issue, Vortex didn't have sufficient permissions
