This is a summary of all of Vortex's commands. Arguments surrounded by `<>` are required, and arguments surrounded by `[]` are optional. Do not include `<>` nor `[]` when running commands!


## ðŸ“œ General Commands
### `>>about`
Shows information about the bot, including its version number, some features, and a few statistics.

### `>>invite`
Provides Vortex's invite link. If you are having trouble inviting Vortex, make sure you are correctly logged in at https://discordapp.com/login

### `>>lookup <ID | invite>`
Finds information about a user or guild via ID (for either) or an invite code (for guilds only). All information found in this way is information that Discord makes publicly-available, and is not impacted by Vortex being in the guilds nor having mutual servers with the user.

### `>>ping`
Checks Vortex's latency. 

### `>>serverinfo`
Shows information about the server this command is used in. 

### `>>userinfo [user]`
Shows information about the provided user, or yourself if you don't include any arguments.


## ðŸ“œ Moderation Commands
These commands can be run if a user's native Discord permissions would allow using the command, or if they have the designated mod role (see the Settings commands below).

### `>>kick <@users or user IDs...> [reason]`
Kicks all of the provided users (or user IDs). If a reason is included, that reason is used in the audit log and moderation log.

### `>>ban <@users or user IDs...> [time] [reason]`
Bans all of the provided users (or user IDs). If a length of time is included, the users will be unbanned after the provided time. If a reason is included, that reason is used in the audit log and moderation log.

### `>>softban <@users or user IDs...> [reason]`
Bans and then immediately unbans all the provided users. This is useful to simultaneously kick a user and clean all of their recent messages. If a reason is included, that reason is used in the audit log and moderation log.

### `>>clean <parameters>`
Cleans all messages in the current channel matching the given parameters. See [[Cleaning Messages]] for more detailed information about this command.

### `>>voicemove [channel]`

### `>>mute <@users or user IDs...> [time] [reason]`
Gives the 'Muted' role to all of the provided users. If a length of time is included, the users will be unmuted after the provided time. If a reason is included, that reason is used in the audit log and moderation log. 

### `>>unmute <@users or user IDs...> [reason]`
Removes the 'Muted' role from all of the provided users. If a reason is included, that reason is used in the audit log and moderation log. 

### `>>raidmode [ON | OFF] [reason]`
Enables or disables Anti-Raid Mode. If no arguments are included, it will show if Anti-Raid Mode is currently active. During Anti-Raid Mode, the server's verification will be increased (no higher than Tableflip) and all users that attempt to join the server will be informed that the server is under lockdown and then kicked. See [[Anti-Raid Mode]] for more information.

### `>>strike [number] <@users or user IDs...> <reason>`
Gives the specified number of strikes (or 1 if not specified) to the provided users. Each user will receive a private message warning them about the accumulated strikes and reason.

Removes the specified number of strikes (or 1 if not specified) to the provided users. Each user will receive a private message letting them know of the pardon and reason.

Edits a reason in the Moderation Log. If no case number is provided, Vortex will search the log for the most-recent case that has no provided reason.

## ðŸ“œ Automod Commands
Please see the [[Auto Moderation]] page for more in-depth descriptions of these features. All of these commands require the Manage Server permission to use.

### `>>antiinvite <strikes>`
Sets the number of strikes a user receives when they post a Discord invite link

### `>>maxmentions <number | OFF>`
Sets the maximum unique, non-bot mentions a user can send in a single message. Any message containing more than the maximum will be deleted, and users will receive one strike for every additional mention.

### `>>maxmentions role <number | OFF>`

### `>>antiduplicate <strike threshold> [delete threshold] [strikes]`
Sets the values to control and punish duplicate messages. `<strike threshold>` determines when duplicate messages will start accumulating strikes.

### `>>autoraidmode <ON | OFF | joins/seconds>`
Configures Vortex to automatically enable Anti-Raid Mode when it senses a raid. Setting `joins/seconds` will enable Anti-Raid Mode if there are at least `joins` new joins to the server within `seconds` seconds. Setting this to `ON` uses 10 joins in 10 seconds.
